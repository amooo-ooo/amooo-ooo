Hi everyone!
I'm Amor, nice to meet you all! I use the pronouns (he/him). I'm a highschool student interested in programming (currently working and learning Python, C#, Batch, R, HTML), basically anything to do with technology, graphic design and mathematics. I have weird tastes in music and games. Feel free to contact me on discord: sardines#9015
